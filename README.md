# Why Clinic management System in EBG?

The following points briefly explain why clinic management system is so important and should be implemented in EBG?
•When the clinic staff or nurses work on manual paper work it kills a lot of time and they have a tendency to commit errors when they organize the document manually.
•The patients need accurate and reliable information about their status in the clinic.
•The patients need to know the amount of the money they used from their annual allowable amount insurance and check the limit if it reaches or not at the maximum refund amount at any instance of time. 



# Django_WebApp General Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a fast, efficient and time saving system for the working environment and decreases the work overload currently imposed to the clinic staffs of the company. This system will change the existing manual paper work system to computerized system. It will provide the clinic staffs to concentrate on very critical and important issues rather than wasting time on this type of simple work after it solved.

# Specific Objectives

The specific objectives are:
•	Creating graphical user interface for the clinic staff users 
•	Creating log in log out authentication
•	Showing detail view for each class in the database  
•	Adding a search bar for each specific fields in each class
•	Adding view pdf and download document from the database 

# Software Development Environment (tools)

In this software development I have used:
•	Python 3.10.1 –django  v4,postgre as back end
•	Visual studio code editor community version 
•	HTML,CSS,JS and bootstrap as front end

Feasibility Study
Feasibility study is a test of system proposal according to its workability, impact of the organization, ability to meet needs and effective use of the resources. It focuses on these major questions:

1. What are the user’s demonstrable needs and how does a candidate system meet them?
2. What resources are available for given candidate system?
3. What are the likely impacts of the candidate system on the organization?
4. Whether it is worth to solve the problem?

# Technical feasibility
A study of resource availability that may affect the ability to achieve an acceptable
System. This evaluation determines whether the technology needed for the proposed
system is available or not.
•	Can the work for the project be done with current equipment existing software
           and technology & available personal?
•	Can the system be upgraded if developed?
•	If new technology is needed, then what can be developed?
This is concerned with specifying equipment and software that will successfully satisfy
the user requirement. The technical needs of the system may include:
Front-end and back-end selection:
An important issue for the development of a project is the selection of suitable front-end
and back-end. When we decided to develop the project we went through an extensive
Study to determine the most suitable platform that suits the needs of the organization as
well as helps in development of the project.
The aspects of our study included the following factors.
# Front-end selection:
1. It must have a graphical user interface that assists employees that are not from IT background.
2. Scalability and extensibility.
3. Flexibility.
4. Robustness.
5. According to the organization requirement and the culture.
6. Must provide excellent reporting features with good printing support.
7. Platform independent.
8. Easy to debug and maintain.
9. Event driven programming facility.
10. Front end must support some popular back end like MySQL, Postgre.
According to the above stated features we selected Python-Django platform using front ends HTML, CSS and JS as the front-end for developing my project.
# Back-end Selection:
1. Multiple user support.
2. Efficient data handling.
3. Provide inherent features for security.
4. Efficient data retrieval and maintenance.
5. Operating System compatible.
6. Easy to install.
7. Easy to implant with the Front-end.

According to above stated features I selected postgre which is one of the basic DBMS which can be connected with python-django platform as the backend.
The technical feasibility is frequently the most difficult area encountered at this stage. It is essential that the process of analysis and definition be conducted in parallel with an
Assessment to technical feasibility. It centers on the existing computer system
(Hardware, Software etc.) And to what extent it can support the proposed system.
